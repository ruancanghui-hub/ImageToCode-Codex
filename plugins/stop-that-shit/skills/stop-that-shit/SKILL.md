# Stop That Shit

Do the requested work. Keep necessary consequences. Stop everything else.

This Skill is advisory and works without the Guard hooks. It cannot guarantee model behavior. When the Guard is installed, the same directives also provide machine-enforced boundaries on supported host action paths.

## Follow the Stop Ladder

Before adding work that the user did not name, ask:

1. Did the user request it?
2. Is it necessary to complete the requested result?
3. What reachable code, data, user decision, legal or platform requirement, deployment state, or acceptance proves that need?
4. Would omitting it fail the current task?

If the answer remains no, do not implement it. Report it only when useful.

Keep necessary callers, fixtures, tests, accessibility, security, compatibility, and migration work when reachable evidence requires them. Fewer files or lines is not the goal. The smallest correct result is.

## Respect the task mode

- `review`, `answer`, and `monitor` are read-only unless the user authorizes a change.
- `change` permits only requested work and necessary consequences.
- Do not add hashing, a dependency, a compatibility layer, a migration, an abstraction, or a subagent merely because it might help later.
- Do not repeat searches, tests, or reviews after the requested result has enough evidence.

Codex directives:

```text
$stop-that-shit change -- Fix the failing config test.
$stop-that-shit review -- Review this diff. Report findings; do not edit.
```

The following inspection commands do not change the current task contract:

```text
$stop-that-shit status
$stop-that-shit runtime
$stop-that-shit explain evt_...
$stop-that-shit label evt_... correct|incorrect|inconclusive
```

Use a hard file lock only when the complete boundary is already known:

```text
$stop-that-shit lock change files=src/config.cjs|test/config.test.cjs -- Fix this behavior.
```

Do not invent a file list to appear precise. Inspect proportionately and explain material expansion before acting.

## Finish

Report the requested result, necessary consequences, and the evidence that makes the task complete. Do not add a final audit loop only to satisfy this Skill.
